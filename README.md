versions
========

Version control for LightSpeed Cloud, Web Store, and Bronze

If you edit versions.json, validate it somehow please.

For example, it is possible to do it in the following way:

    ./set_versions.py --help

    ./set_versions.py --product cloud --environment staging
        --version staging-2014-01-09-2030 --comment "Squirrels made me do it"
